# US Public Water Systems

The aim of this analysis is to train my skills in python by exploring a public dataset. I chose the _public water systems_ data collected by the EPA.   

Everything is documented in the notebook: US-Public-Water-Systems/US Drinking Water Quality Violations.ipynb

**It might be that the notebook is too voluminous to be viewed on github (?)**

Source of the data: https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-model.
